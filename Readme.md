WORK IN PROGRESS

Todo (short-term): 

- add support for user names
  - (and passwords)
- add separate chats between:
  - pairs of users
  - groups of users
- add tangent feature
- construct a viable schema for all of the above

Todo (medium-term):
- add a remote client

Potential long-term questions:
1. How to dump data we don't need (old testing, etc.)
2. Update-proofing (changes in schema, moving the DB to another host, etc.)
